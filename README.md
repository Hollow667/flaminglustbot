# flaminglustbot

This is a twitter bot designed to tweet out steamy 'love scenes' generated from word lists. It will also reply to anyone who replies to it with a tweet plugging one of its non-existant, auto-generated erotic ebooks.

***WARNING***
This bot generates explicit adult content! You must be 18+ to use or modify this bot!

The bot uses the python library tweepy to access the twitter API. It requires a file called twitterauth.py which is **not** contained in this repo.

To run this bot:

# lust_bot [-tweet] [-numtweets NUMTWEETS] [-test TEST] [-tweettimer TWEETTIMER] [-replytimer REPLYTIMER]

All args optional, but you must include **-tweet** if you want the bot to actually tweet what it generates.
